## Technologies I Use:

Here are the technologies I work with across different domains:

### Native Android Apps: Jetpack Compose
Jetpack Compose is a modern UI toolkit for building beautiful Android apps with a declarative approach. It allows me to create interactive and visually appealing user interfaces, making development faster and more efficient.

### Web Apps: Svelte
Svelte is a lightweight JavaScript framework that enables me to build fast and efficient web applications. With its reactive approach, I can create dynamic user interfaces and deliver optimal performance to users.

### Cross-Platform Apps: QtQuick, Flutter
QtQuick is a powerful framework that allows me to build cross-platform apps using C++. It provides a rich set of UI components and supports rapid development, making it a great choice for multi-platform applications.

Flutter, on the other hand, is a UI toolkit that allows me to build beautiful and fast apps using a single codebase in Dart. It provides a rich set of pre-built widgets and offers a smooth development experience for creating cross-platform applications.

### Backend Development: ASP.NET Core, Flask, Actix
ASP.NET Core is a versatile framework for building web applications and APIs using C#. It offers a wide range of features and tools that enable me to create scalable and robust backend solutions.

Flask is a lightweight web framework in Python that allows me to quickly build web applications. It provides simplicity and flexibility, making it ideal for smaller projects or rapid prototyping.

Actix is a high-performance, actor-based web framework in Rust. With its asynchronous and non-blocking design, Actix enables me to build highly efficient and scalable backend systems.

### Games: SDL2
SDL2 is a popular cross-platform library for building games and multimedia applications. It provides low-level access to audio, graphics, and input devices, allowing me to create immersive gaming experiences.
